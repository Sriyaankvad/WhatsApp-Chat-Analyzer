# WhatsApp Chat Analyzer
 A Jupyter Notebook using Pandas and MatPlotLib to gain statistics about a WhatsApp Group Chat, specifically:
 - The amount of messages sent per user
 - The total number of messages sent based on hour
 - The number of messages sent each month
 
 To Run this Program:
 - Make an export of your WhatsApp Group Chat and place it in the same folder as analyzer.ipynb
  - Make sure the export is named '_chat.txt'
 - Run the ipynb file through method of your choice (Jupyter Notebook, VS Code etc)
 
 Note: The chat in the example shown had its chat export manually modified to protect personal information etc. This program does not edit the chat export.
